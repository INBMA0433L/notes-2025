### Basic exercises

1. Delete each medal table entry that does not have at least `1` gold medal.

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM o_medal_table
   WHERE gold = 0;
   ```

1. Delete the country which name is *American Samoa*!

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM o_countries
   WHERE name = 'American Samoa';
   ``

1. Delete the country which name is *Hungary*!

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM o_countries
   WHERE name = 'Hungary';
   ```

   *Why cannot we delete Hungary but American Samoa?*

### Subquery-based exercises

1. Delete each country that does not have any medals.

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM o_countries
   WHERE c_id NOT IN (
      SELECT country_id
      FROM o_medal_table
   );
   ```

1. Delete each discipline that does not have any events.

   ```sql
   DELETE FROM o_sport_disciplines
   WHERE d_id NOT IN (
      SELECT discipline_id
      FROM o_sport_events
   );
   ```

1. Delete each event that which name is present and it does not have any corresponding result.

   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM o_sport_events
   WHERE
      name IS NOT NULL
      AND NOT EXISTS(
         SELECT *
         FROM o_results
         WHERE event_id = e_id
   );
   ```
