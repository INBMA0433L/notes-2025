## Exercises

1. Return the **average number of countries per continent**.

   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(countries)
   FROM (
      SELECT continent, COUNT(*) AS countries
      FROM o_countries
      GROUP BY continent
   );
   ```

1. Return the **average number of countries per continent**. Do not deal with countries whose continent is unknown.

   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(countries)
   FROM (
      SELECT continent, COUNT(*) AS countries
      FROM o_countries
      WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
      GROUP BY continent
   );
   ```

1. Return each **continent** and the **number of corresponding countries**. Return a continent if it has more countries than the average.

   ```sql
   SELECT continent, COUNT(*)
   FROM o_countries
   GROUP BY continent
   HAVING COUNT(*) > (
      SELECT AVG(countries)
      FROM (
         SELECT continent, COUNT(*) AS countries
         FROM o_countries
         WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
         GROUP BY continent
      )
   );
   ```

1. Return each **capital** with the **number of capitals** beginning with the same letter.

   ```sql
   SELECT capital, capitals
   FROM o_countries
      JOIN (SELECT SUBSTR(capital, 1, 1) AS letter,
                  COUNT(*)              AS capitals
            FROM o_countries
            GROUP BY SUBSTR(capital, 1, 1))
         ON SUBSTR(capital, 1, 1) = letter;
   ```
   
1. Return the **name**, the **continent**, and the **population** of each country that has the greatest population in its continent.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, continent, population
   FROM o_countries a
   WHERE population = (
      SELECT MAX(population)
      FROM o_countries b
      WHERE a.continent = b.continent
   );
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT
      name, continent, population
   FROM o_countries
      NATURAL JOIN (
      SELECT 
         continent,
         MAX(population) AS max_population
      FROM o_countries
      GROUP BY continent
   )
   WHERE
      population = max_population;
   ```

1. Return each **continent** and its **gold medals** if it is greater than the average.

   ```sql
   SELECT continent, SUM(gold)
   FROM o_countries
      JOIN o_medal_table ON c_id = country_id
   GROUP BY continent
   HAVING SUM(gold) > (
      SELECT AVG(gold)
      FROM (
         SELECT continent, SUM(gold) AS gold
         FROM o_countries
            JOIN o_medal_table ON c_id = country_id
         WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
         GROUP BY continent
      )
   );
   ```
