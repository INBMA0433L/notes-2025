## Exercises

1. Return **each value** that both appears in the `gold` and `bronze` columns of the medal table.

   1. Solve the exercise without using set operators.

      ```sql
      SELECT DISTINCT gold
      FROM o_medal_table
      WHERE gold IN (
         SELECT bronze
         FROM o_medal_table
      );
      ```

   1. Solve the exercise using set operators.

      ```sql
      SELECT gold
      FROM o_medal_table
      INTERSECT
      SELECT bronze
      FROM o_medal_table;
      ```

1. Return **each value** that appears in the `gold` or `bronze` column of the medal table.

   ```sql
   SELECT gold
   FROM o_medal_table
   UNION
   SELECT bronze
   FROM o_medal_table;
   ```

1. Return **each value** that appears in the `gold` column but does not appear in the `bronze` column of the medal table.

   1. Solve the exercise without using set operators.

      ```sql
      SELECT DISTINCT gold
      FROM o_medal_table
      WHERE gold NOT IN (
         SELECT bronze
         FROM o_medal_table
      );
      ```

   1. Solve the exercise using set operators.

      ```sql
      SELECT gold
      FROM o_medal_table
      MINUS
      SELECT bronze
      FROM o_medal_table;
      ```

      SELECT DISTINCT SUBSTR(name, 1, 1)
      FROM o_countries
      WHERE SUBSTR(name, 1, 1) NOT IN (
         SELECT SUBSTR(continent, 1, 1)
         FROM o_countries
         WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
      );
      ```
      
   1. Solve the exercise using set operators.

      ```sql
      SELECT SUBSTR(name, 1, 1)
      FROM o_countries
      MINUS
