### Single JOIN

1. Return the **name** of each country together with its **gold**, **silver**, and **bronze** medals. Return a country only if it scored at least one medal.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, gold, silver, bronze
   FROM o_countries
      JOIN o_medal_table ON c_id = country_id;
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT name, gold, silver, bronze
   FROM o_countries
      CROSS JOIN o_medal_table
   WHERE c_id = country_id;
   ```

1. Return the **name** of each country together with its **gold**, **silver**, and **bronze** medals. Return each country even if it has not scored any medals.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, gold, silver, bronze
   FROM o_countries
      LEFT JOIN o_medal_table ON c_id = country_id;
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT name, gold, silver, bronze
   FROM o_countries,
      o_medal_table
   WHERE c_id = country_id(+);
   ```

1. Return the **name** of each country together with its **gold**, **silver**, and **bronze** medals. Return each country even if it has not scored any medals. Return zero (`0`) values instead of the `NULL` values.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, gold, silver, bronze
   FROM o_countries
      LEFT JOIN o_medal_table ON c_id = country_id;
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT name, NVL(gold, 0), NVL(silver, 0), NVL(bronze, 0)
   FROM o_countries,
      o_medal_table
   WHERE c_id = country_id(+);
   ```

1. Return the **name** of each European country together with its **gold**, **silver**, and **bronze** medals. Return each country even if it has not scored any medals. Return zero (`0`) values instead of the `NULL` values.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, NVL(gold, 0), NVL(silver, 0), NVL(bronze, 0)
   FROM o_countries
      LEFT JOIN o_medal_table ON c_id = country_id
   WHERE continent = 'Europe';
   ```

1. Return the **name** of each European country together with its **gold**, **silver**, and **bronze** medals. Return each country even if it has not scored any medals. Return zero (`0`) values instead of the `NULL` values.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, NVL(gold, 0), NVL(silver, 0), NVL(bronze, 0)
   FROM o_countries
      LEFT JOIN o_medal_table ON c_id = country_id
   WHERE continent = 'Europe'
   ORDER BY gold, name;
   ```

   What is the problem with this query?

   ```sql
   SELECT name, NVL(gold, 0), NVL(silver, 0), NVL(bronze, 0)
   FROM o_countries

   GROUP BY continent;
   ```

1. Return each **continent** with its **gold**, **silver**, and **bronze** medals. Display the `"unknown"` string instead of the `NULL` values.

   FROM o_countries
      LEFT JOIN o_medal_table ON c_id = country_id
   GROUP BY continent;
   ```

1. Return each **continent** with its **gold**, **silver**, and **bronze** medals. Display the `"unknown"` string instead of the `NULL` values. Order the rows by the gold medals in descending order.

   FROM o_countries
      LEFT JOIN o_medal_table ON c_id = country_id
   GROUP BY continent
   ORDER BY SUM(gold) DESC;
   ```
